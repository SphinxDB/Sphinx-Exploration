## 1. Introduction to Sphinx Protocol Changes

The primary goal of Sphinx DB has been to ensure the integrity of database queries. This focus stems from identified challenges with the current process, where running Cairo on a single computer and transferring data to Starknet might compromise data reliability. Such a method risks local manipulation of the database, presenting a false appearance of verification. To counteract these challenges, recent efforts have concentrated on developing critical solutions that either eliminate or significantly reduce reliance on external reliability assurances for SphinxDB. To minimize trust, we have adopted the idea of setting up a network where users can share the requests they want to verify to minimize trust. When setting up this network, we are implementing things like TLSnotary to ensure zero toxicity.

This initiative represents a pivotal shift in how we address the potential for data manipulation and falsification, marking a significant stride toward enhancing the protocol's security and trustworthiness.

## 2. General overview of Sphinx Protocol

The initial phase of the Sphinx Protocol involves serving as a notary for TLS requests, wherein it generates zero-knowledge proofs (zk proofs) for both the existence of data and the data itself. This process enhances the protocol's ability to ensure the integrity of information. Subsequently, this validated data can be written to Starknet, rendering it accessible and functional.

In next phases of development, users utilizing the Sphinx protocol will gain the capability to generate custom TLS requests, thereby extending the protocol's flexibility and utility. This marks a significant progression in the protocol's evolution, allowing users to tailor their interactions according to specific requirements.

As the protocol matures, the focus will shift towards transforming Sphinx into a network. This pivotal phase will witness the development of a consensus protocol, a fundamental component in establishing a robust and decentralized infrastructure. This consensus mechanism will play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and security of the network, ensuring that all participants reach agreement on the state of the system.

In the final stage of evolution, the Sphinx protocol will undergo changes to enable seamless operation across multiple chains while being Starknet-first. This modification is aimed at enhancing interoperability and adaptability, enabling the protocol to navigate and interact within a diverse blockchain ecosystem. These comprehensive developments showcase the strategic evolution of the Sphinx protocol, from a TLS notary to a versatile and interoperable system with a robust consensus mechanism.

## 3. Architecture

In this section, we present an overview of the general architecture of the Sphinx protocol in its final form. However, it's important to note that the actual product launch is slated to occur after the completion of theÂ [second stage](#52-stage-2-implementation-of-writing-data-to-starknet), which will be elaborated upon in greater detail in [Section 5](#5-development-phases-of-sphinx-protocol).

The Sphinx protocol, at its core, operates as a decentralized network, empowering users and developers to generate custom TLSNotary requests. These requests can be seamlessly transmitted to the network, allowing users to obtain proof of their response data in a permissionless and trustless manner. The protocol's initial integration is designed to work with Starknet, offering users the flexibility to retain their data within the Sphinx network or extend their reach to various other supported chains.

The unique feature of Sphinx lies in its ability to facilitate the verification process and securely anchor proofs on-chain. This ensures a robust and tamper-resistant validation mechanism. Post-verification, users gain the capability to write their data onto any supported chain within the ecosystem.

To provide a more detailed understanding, let's delve into [Section 5](#5-development-phases-of-sphinx-protocol), where we outline the various development phases of the Sphinx protocol. This structured approach encompasses the implementation of essential components, such as the introduction of custom TLSNotary requests, writing data to Starknet, handling user requests, deploying a consensus protocol, and eventually expanding data writing capabilities to other chains. The subsequent sections will provide a comprehensive breakdown of each stage, offering insights into the protocol's evolution and functionality.

Let's expand on the flow of a user's request example as it progresses through the stages within the Sphinx protocol:

1. User Initiates the Request. For example a user submits a request to the network, aiming to demonstrate that they were born in the 8th month.
2. To ensure decentralization and enhance security, a random selection process designates one validator or verifier as the head verifier. This head verifier, in turn, selects an additional subset of validators, denoted as x (with the specific value to be determined through benchmarking). In this illustrative example, let's consider x as 2, resulting in a total of 3 validators, including the head verifier, engaged in the verification process for the user's TLS request.

3. The head verifier takes on the role of a TLSNotary, serving as a proxy between the user and the web server. Utilizing the multiparty handshake keys generated by the selected subset of validators and the prover, the head verifier employs TLSNotary to verify the data from the web server. This multiparty handshake ensures a secure and verifiable interaction between the user and the web server.

4. As the TLSNotary verification unfolds, the remaining validators within the selected subset independently verify the proof's validity and authenticate the data. Once this verification process is successfully completed, the validated data is written to the relevant chain. This includes both the internal chain of the Sphinx Protocol and potentially other external chains (Starknet will be the first chain) supported by the broader ecosystem.

This detailed walkthrough demonstrates the meticulous process through which user requests are securely handled within the Sphinx protocol. By integrating TLSNotary, it enables multiparty handshake keys, and utilizing a collaborative network of validators, the Sphinx Protocol ensures the trustless and tamper-resistant verification of user-requested data, fostering a robust and reliable environment for user interactions within the network.

## 4. Synthesizing Insights for the Sphinx Protocol: A Comprehensive Review of Existing Technologies

As the research phase nears its end, our team has conducted a thorough investigation of relevant implementations in the field of protocols. This effort has led to the generation of detailed reports that outline the identified protocols, providing insights into their possible use and how they might inform improvements to the Sphinx protocol.

In reviewing key papers during this phase, we have carefully considered the pros and cons of each to extract valuable lessons for our protocol's development. Our goal is to leverage the benefits of existing technologies while being aware of their limitations, striving to create a protocol that is both forward-thinking and attuned to the obstacles encountered by comparable systems.

This research endeavor involves a systematic review of the various facets of these protocols, including their architectures, security measures, and scalability features. The objective is to discern elements that align with our goals and can fortify the Sphinx protocol in terms of reliability and efficiency.

In summary, this research phase represents a crucial step in synthesizing knowledge from relevant papers, extracting valuable lessons, and synthesizing a well-informed approach to further develop our protocol. The amalgamation of these insights will serve as a robust foundation as we transition from the research phase into the implementation and refinement stages of the Sphinx protocol.
